I woke up
I walked my dog Logan
I ate breakfast
I went to school

Because so many students were absent, we watched one of the "greatest" movie of all time, "Paul Blart: Mall Cop", in class but I fell asleep mid way through the movie.
I sat through some classes
I came home 
I walked Logan again
I went to sleep
